\section{Introduction} 
The scientific and techonlogical progress in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (AIR) has been rapdily moving forward over the past decade, specially in countries such as United States, China and Europe where support of such fields is part of their agenda \cite{Savage2020}. 
However, such pupport brings other challenges such as the little to none focus on a centered AIR for children as well as the challenge of making the fields of AIR avaible to under-represented communities.
In terms of a child-centered AIR, ...
Similarly, such technologies are unreaachable to young audiences from under-represented communities as recently pointed out by United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) \cite{UNICEF2020}.
That said, this work is proposing Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Children (AIR4children) as a way to make AIR avaiable to young audiences with perhaps limited resources and to creation and design tools based on open-sourced projects to address fairness and accesibility. 
Additionally, AIR4children is aiming to design curriculums with an non-traditional education approach for children of different socieconomical backgrounds, developmental stages or learning abilitities. 

For this work, section 2 review open source projects as a way to minise cost for hardware and software as the basis of the materal for air4children which is presented in section 3. 
Then, we conclude with current status of AIR for children, open source materials for hardware, software and teaching and add few words on the future work as a way to mitigate few of the challenges cited above. 

\section{Open Source Projects in AI and Robotics}
The spirit of open source software since 19XX with the contributions 
of users of different skills made a culture of openly share code to make
more robust tools (i.e. firefox, ubuntu, etc). Much recently, something 
similar to software is happening for hardware. One example is the community 
for arduino that open-sourced diagrams, code and with a low-cost microcontroller
magaged to make wordwile impact. See ~\ref{tab:opensourceprojects}.

[Deep Learning (DL) is a branch of machine learning in Artificial Intelligence
which essentially takes advantage of a huge datasets to train neural networks.
The great impact of DL in recent years is also because of improvements in 
hardware development and mainly because of open source tools and libraries \cite{matelabs2017}.
Additionally to that, there is a huge range of applications in areas such as robotics,
transportation, medicine and last but not least in education.
That said, we propose to use a raspberry pi, a $\pounds$30 board with
GNU/Linux OS, connected with a mini arduino board, $\pounds$2 board,  servomotors 
and pi camera in order to create a simple low-cost educational robot 
where children can learn the basics concepts of robotics and deep learning \cite{durr2015}.

\section{AIR4Children as a open source project}
Having known the benefits of not only the lower price of open source projects but the increase of customisation and control of these, AIR4Children is therfore intending to adopt a similar journey along the lines of open source principles with the aim of making low-cost, customiseble and accesible tools for a child-centred AIR.
That said, in a first phase, AIR4CHILDREN project will be piloting teaching materials with our open source robots and otto, a well known open source educational robot.  
Then in a second phase, and with feedback of the pilots, teaching materials as well as the customisation of open source robots will be improved to polish a more centred-child curriculum of AIR. 
On a third phase, children and adolescents in a range of age between 6 to 14 years old will be invited to enroll on workshops that will be free to all the particpants. 
This inital phases of the project will help us to provide evidence of the impact of AIR in a children of different backgrounds and evaluate their perception on the fields of AI and Robotics.  

%% BLURS 
%On a third phase at least once a year we celebrate a public exposition, where the children talk with other children and their parents, 
%showing their robots, sharing their experiences, and interacting between the public and the team so that the general population 
%has a new perception of AIR.

%The pilot project is being implemented in Xicohtzinco, a town from Tlaxcala, Mexico, with a population of, [refs].
%for children and adolescents in
%In these courses we use different game-based learning techniques [refs], they are taught Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (construction and programming).   
%The programs and equipment used will be open, currently work with [refs], in section 3.1. looks more in detail.  
%In the second phase, the children who took the course  are invited to be part of an AIR team, 
%which will have permanent meetings, and will work on specific projects to participate on IAR competition events. 

%to "play AIR" through calls to summer courses.   
%The groups are formed according to their ages. 
%In this case the groups are formed according to their capabilities.

%The general population, parents and children consider that Robotics is for people with a high IQ, engineers, complicated to learn, 
%and too expensive, in one word, 
%We are working on changing this perception...
%is focused on achieving that AIR be perceived as a “game” or like a recreational activity,
% similar to swim, ride a bike, do chemical experiments, play chess, that the child says things like: 
% “I want to play AIR (Robotics)”, “dear Santa Claus my wish is that you bring me a Robotic set”, “friend let's play to build a robot”.   



\subsection{Open hardware and software}
Considering previous references from the open source community, or perhaps other emerging ones, of not only AI and Robotics but also the ones for hardware and software, AIR4Children is aiming to make its resources accesible to young audiences \cite{UNICEF2020}.
For instance, one additional goal of air4children is to build and to design low-cost education robots as a way to mitigate the hight prices of educational robots.
Our initial prototype called ro-bit can recongnise voice commands in English language to move the robot in different directions (Fig \ref{fig:teaser} a).
Another example is otto robot, a DIY educational robot based on arduino, servomotors and a scratch like interface to program the robot (Fig \ref{fig:teaser} b).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Open teaching materials}
Considering the work of Maria Montessori who emphasized “the hand is the instrument of the mind.” \cite{montessori2013absorbent}. 
That said, children must develop concentration to develop their learning skills. 
For instance, the best way a child can concentrate is by fixing his attention on some task he is performing with his hands. 
It is through movement and repetition that the child gets experience, allowing him to internalize new concepts. 
One potential way to develip such skills is the help of activities in engigering and robotics. 
Engineering and robotics has demonstrated that young children can experience a range of cognitive and social benefits when these materials are approprietely introduced in development stages \cite{bers2008, bers-horn2010, kazakoff-bers2012}.
Engineering tasks in robotics allow children to participate in creative explorations, develop fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination, engage in collaboration and teamwork \cite{elkin2014}.
Similarly, the children development of grasping and understanding mathematical concepts such as number, size, and shape \cite{bers2012, resnick1998}.

In that way, air4children's workshop integrates various hands-on activities where the children will develop different intellectual and social skills to incorporate into other areas of their lives.
More specifically, such workshops are based on several Montessori principles such as: moving from the simple to the complex, the concrete to the abstract, the familiar to the unfamiliar and the general to the specific, as well as a mixed age group, where children can learn from each other.
For instance, Elkin et al. (2014) \cite{elkin2014} explained how Robotics can also provide a way to engage children in problem-solving. 
Finding solutions together translate to social situations as well as it provides children with the foundations for decision making, logical reasoning, categorizing, analytical thinking, negotiation, and creativity. 

%Using a variety of teaching materials that combine theory and practice, our workshop has the goal to create experiences to build children’s confidence, develop creativity, teamwork and curiosity.
%During these activities they are observed in order to: i) discover individual and team skills, ii) develop their talents, and iii) monitor their growth.  

%[Section to describe open teaching materials, perhaps using non-traditional education systems.]
%Serholt 2017 performed studies to quantify the social intereaction 
%between robots and children (i.e., gaze, verbal interaction, gestures, 
%and facial expressions). However robotics tutors are not yet to the point 
%to deal with complex child-robot interactions. 
%\cite{Serholt:2017}

\section{Conclusions and future work}
We introducted the term air4project as a project with the aim to tackle aspects for inclusion, accesibility, transparency, equity, fairness and participation of children in the fields of AI and Robotics as well as to create a more child-centre approach for AI and Robotics.
In this work, we also touched on the open source projects in AI and Robotics as a corner stone for air4children with the aim of minise cost of the materials and made customised eduational material.  
Similarly, it has been presented the three phases for air4children for piloting, impleting and refiningg workshops for children in the age range between 6 to 14. 
We also touched on the creation of curriclumns with Montesoty education, a non-traditional eduational approach to help young audienes to develiip skills such as think creatively with curisitty and open-minded as well as develop a have a sense of wonder and joy in learning.

For future plans, in the coming year, we will complete the first round of eduational material for a child-centre AI and robotics where pilots, workshops and showcases are part of the 2021 and 2022 agenda.  

%% BLURS 
%Since children are going to learn and enter to this vast world of technology is in our responsibility to create open safe platforms and strategies where every children can enter and learn about AI, regardless of their personal situation, to avoid creating an “AI divide”. 
%To create a free safe space means the development and implementation of new AI policies focused on children, and the creation of digital public goods including open AI models, open software and so on.
%In our fast-evolving world towards technology is important to teach children what they are going to face when they grow up, unfortunately many children don’t have access to technology or the opportunity to learn about robotics and AI, and others, although they already know this type of technology, they don’t know how it works and how to create more of this technology which is really important towards the future. 
%This project aims for that goal, create a free space where we can help children know and comprehend the functionality of Robotics and AI so they can obtain the best of it and create even more technology, with a positive impact in society, regardless of their opportunities or status, we believe that every children has the potential to learn and create.
