## Abstract
We introduce AIR4Children, Artificial Intelligence for Children, as a way to (a) tackle aspects for inclusion accessibility, transparency, equity, fairness and participation and (b) to create affordable child-centred materials in AI and Robotics (AIR). 
We present current challenges and opportunities for a child-centred approaches for AIR. 
Similarly, we touch on open-sourced software and hardware technologies to make a more inclusive, affordable and fair participation of children in areas of AIR. 
Then, we describe the avenues that AIR4Children can take with the development of open-sourced software and hardware based on our initial pilots and experiences.
Similarly, we propose to follow the philosophy of Montessori education to help children to not only develop computational thinking but also to internalise new concepts and learning skills through activities of movement and repetition.
Finally, we conclude with the opportunities of our work and mainly we pose the future work of putting in practice what is proposed here to evaluate the potential impact on AIR to children, instructors, parents and their community.
