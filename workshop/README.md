# Child-Robot Interaction & Child's Fundamental Rights
Workshop in conjunction with the ACM International Conference of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI2021)
8 March 2021 (online)

## About the workshop
As robotic technology - from simple robotic toys to more advanced social robots - is becoming a common sight in private and in public spaces such as schools, it is important to understand its overall impact on child's development. An important aspect of this process is the consideration of the existing work on children's protection such as the Convention of the Rights of the Child published by the United Nations which refers to aspects such as inclusion and non-discrimination, agency, privacy, dignity, transparency, equity, fairness and participation.

Currently, national and global organizations have raised concerns regarding the design, the development and the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in applications that are used by or relate to children. UNICEF for example has proposed a set of requirements for AI and child's rights in order for researchers industry and policy-makers to adopt a more child-centred approach.

* How can we develop Trustworthy Robots for Children?
* How is your research contributing to child-robot interaction from a Child's Rights perspective?
* How can the consideration of Children's Fundamental Rights advance the field of Child-Robot Interaction?

This workshop will bring together researchers in the intersection of Human-Robot Interaction, Child Development, Ethics and Robot Design and other relevant fields . We aim to provide a platform to discuss emerging opportunities and risks in Child-Robot Interaction through the lens of the Human Fundamental Rights.
